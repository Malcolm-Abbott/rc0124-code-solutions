# final-project-scope-of-work

## Questions

1. What aspects of the project are still incomplete?

Project is finished.
I have perhaps some stretch features to include in the future, but the baseline project with all of its features are complete.

2. What challenges are you currently facing in your project? What are some specific areas that still need to be investigated?

In the future, incorporating tracking to track the users run while the app is active would be useful.

3. What is your plan to try to overcome these challenges? What resources can you use?

In the future I will look more into Geolocation and how to incorporate that in the app.
