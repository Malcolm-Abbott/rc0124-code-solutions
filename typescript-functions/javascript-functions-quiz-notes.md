- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  a definition is prefixed with the function keyword
  function definition has undefined parameters (if made with parameters)
  function definition has curly braces to contain code block
  function call does not have the function keyword
  function call has function name followed by parenthesis with arguments (if definition had parameters)
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  Parameters are essentially placeholders for future values which will be inputted into the function, which are arguments
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  They give your code functionality and flexibility by not having to re type the code block every time you want to input a different value, but you can simply call the function and input whichever different values you wish to run through the same block of code
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Provides a return value which will be received when calling the function.
