## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  To iterate through a process of running code.
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  To provide alternative code blocks to run based on the criteria laid out in your conditional logic.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  Each execution of the code block provided within the loop is an iteration.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  Before the code block is executed.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  When entering the loop.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  Before each iteration.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  After each iteration of code block.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  break
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  If placed before the variable, increments the variable by 1 and returns the result of that expression.
